## User Story
As a player, 
* I press the play button to start the game. 
* I am given 6 attempts to guess the correct word that consists from 5 letters.
* When I guess a correct character in the right place, the word box turns green, 
When I guess it correctly but in an incorrect spot, the word box turns yellow. 
The box turns grey when I guess a character incorrectly. 
* Keys colour on the keyboard also change.
In this way,  I will know which one I need to continue guessing to reveal the answer.

* Score board will be updated and I can collect the words I answered correctly in my word-bank and an animal sticker per win.

## Roadmap
